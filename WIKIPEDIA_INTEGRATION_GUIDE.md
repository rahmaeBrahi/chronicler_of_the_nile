1. **WikipediaSearcher Class**: Core utility for searching and retrieving Wikipedia content
2. **Contextual Information Extraction**: Intelligent parsing of user messages to identify relevant search terms
3. **Egyptian History Filtering**: Specialized algorithms to identify Egypt-related content
4. **Prompt Enhancement**: Integration of Wikipedia content into AI prompts for richer responses

### Integration Flow

1. **User Message Analysis**: When a user sends a message, the system analyzes it to extract key terms and topics
2. **Wikipedia Search**: The system searches Wikipedia for relevant articles using enhanced queries
3. **Content Filtering**: Results are filtered to prioritize Egyptian history-related content
4. **Context Integration**: Relevant Wikipedia information is added to the AI prompt
5. **Enhanced Response**: The AI generates a response using both its training data and the Wikipedia context

## Technical Implementation

### WikipediaSearcher Class

The `WikipediaSearcher` class provides the following key methods:

#### `search_topics(query, max_results=5)`
Searches Wikipedia for topics related to the query.

```python
searcher = WikipediaSearcher()
results = searcher.search_topics("Cleopatra", max_results=3)
# Returns: ['Cleopatra', 'Cleopatra VII', 'Cleopatra (disambiguation)']
```

#### `get_page_summary(title, sentences=3)`
Retrieves a concise summary of a Wikipedia page.

```python
summary = searcher.get_page_summary("Cleopatra VII", sentences=2)
# Returns: "Cleopatra VII Philopator was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. She was a descendant of Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great."
```

#### `search_egyptian_history(query)`
Specialized search for Egyptian history topics with enhanced filtering.

```python
results = searcher.search_egyptian_history("pyramid construction")
# Returns: Dictionary with Egyptian-related topics and their summaries
```

#### `get_contextual_information(user_message, language='en')`
Main integration method that analyzes user messages and returns relevant Wikipedia context.

```python
context = searcher.get_contextual_information("Tell me about the pyramids of Giza")
# Returns: Formatted Wikipedia information about pyramids, Giza, and related topics
```

### Language Support

The Wikipedia integration supports both English and Arabic queries:

- **English**: Direct Wikipedia searches in English
- **Arabic**: Intelligent translation and search in English Wikipedia with Arabic query understanding
- **Automatic Detection**: Language detection based on character analysis

### Egyptian History Filtering

The system uses a comprehensive keyword database to identify Egyptian history-related content:

```python
egyptian_keywords = [
    'egypt', 'egyptian', 'pharaoh', 'pyramid', 'nile', 'cairo', 'alexandria',
    'cleopatra', 'tutankhamun', 'ramses', 'ptolemy', 'hieroglyph', 'sphinx',
    'luxor', 'karnak', 'thebes', 'memphis', 'giza', 'saqqara', 'abydos',
    'coptic', 'mamluk', 'fatimid', 'ayyubid', 'ottoman egypt', 'muhammad ali',
    'suez', 'aswan', 'nubia', 'kush', 'dynasty', 'kingdom egypt'
]
```

## Configuration

### Dependencies

The Wikipedia integration requires the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install wikipedia python-dotenv
```

These are automatically included in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required for basic Wikipedia functionality. The integration works out of the box with the existing setup.

### Optional Configuration

You can customize the Wikipedia integration by modifying the `WikipediaSearcher` class:

```python
# Set default language
wikipedia_searcher = WikipediaSearcher(language='ar')  # For Arabic Wikipedia

# Customize search parameters
results = searcher.search_topics(query, max_results=10)  # More results

# Adjust summary length
summary = searcher.get_page_summary(title, sentences=5)  # Longer summaries
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

The Wikipedia integration is automatically enabled for all chat interactions. When users ask questions, the system will:

1. Analyze the question for relevant terms
2. Search Wikipedia for related content
3. Include relevant information in the AI response

### Example Conversation Flow

**User**: "Tell me about the construction of the Great Pyramid"

**System Process**:
1. Extracts key terms: "construction", "Great Pyramid"
2. Searches Wikipedia for: "Great Pyramid construction", "Great Pyramid Egypt", "pyramid construction ancient Egypt"
3. Finds relevant articles: "Great Pyramid of Giza", "Egyptian pyramid construction techniques", "Khufu"
4. Adds Wikipedia context to AI prompt
5. Generates enhanced response with current Wikipedia information

**Enhanced Response**: The AI response will include both its training knowledge and current Wikipedia information about pyramid construction techniques, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and related historical context.

### Multi-language Support

**Arabic Query**: "ÿ£ÿÆÿ®ÿ±ŸÜŸä ÿπŸÜ ÿ®ŸÜÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ£Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÖÿßÿ™"

**System Process**:
1. Detects Arabic language
2. Extracts key terms: "ÿ®ŸÜÿßÿ°", "ÿßŸÑÿ£Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÖÿßÿ™"
3. Searches English Wikipedia with translated terms
4. Returns context in format suitable for Arabic response generation

## Advanced Features

### Disambiguation Handling

The system automatically handles Wikipedia disambiguation pages:

```python
# If searching for "Mercury" returns a disambiguation page
# The system automatically selects the most relevant option
# or tries the first available option
```

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling ensures the system continues to function even when Wikipedia is unavailable:

- **Network Errors**: Gracefully degrades to AI-only responses
- **Page Not Found**: Tries alternative search terms
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements respectful request patterns

### Caching and Performance
